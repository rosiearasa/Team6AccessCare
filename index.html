      <h2>ABOUT PAGE</h2>
    </div>
            <p class="commonPara">
      This webpage is a hub dedicated to providing educational and material resources to women and people who are about to have,
      or already have, children. Here you can apply for a care package and also find important maternal health resources and
      services. We want to make resources for maternal health more accessible because there is so much potential for improving
      maternal health for women and people in developing countries. We also hope to eventually provide translated education
      materials to make them more accessible and facilitate a community ride service that enables access to medical care.

      <h2>HOW DOES IT WORK</h2>
    </div>
         <p class="commonPara">
          Below, we have a user-friendly questionnaire. The questionnaire provides customized resources to you based off of your answers 
          with the intention of helping you start on your journey of learning more about maternal health and what options 
          are available to you. 
          Our database consists of trusted and valid organization and resources across different regions in Kenya. 
          We know that searching for resources can be overwhelming, especially when you feel like you don't know 
          where to look and what you need to know.
